# Human-Brain-Parcellation-using-DB-Scan
Implemented density-based scan clustering Machine Learning model for human brain parcellation and detected over 60 clusters in each brain hemisphere. The model was developed using Matlab.
Brodmann's parcellation of the human cerebral cortex, based on cellular architecture, remains the most popular cortical map today, defining 52 regions with similar cellular structures. Although MRI data has been used for cortical mapping, histological images provide higher spatial resolution with actual brain tissue. This study aimed to create an automated, data-driven cortical map using Brodmannâ€™s principles. We extracted five anatomical features from a high-resolution 3D histological brain image (BigBrain) and applied the DB-Scan algorithm, identifying 70 and 67 clusters in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Notably, we identified the SMA and pre-SMA regions, which were not present in Brodmann's areas, and further divided regions like the pre-central gyrus and superior frontal gyrus into smaller sub-regions, consistent with the Julich-Brain atlas. This is the first application of DB-Scan in neuroimaging, and our approach may be valuable for studying individual variability in the cerebral cortex in future research.
